The SQLAlchemy library used by this project requires an environment variable
called `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_URL` that can be used to establish a connection to a
database. The URL should be something like
`sql_dialect://username:password@host:port/database` (see the SQLAlchemy
[docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#database-urls) for
details).
